This file is part of SWAYAM NPTEL, programming data structures and algorithms using python
The main focous in this course is 
Algorithms that manipulate information
for example
compute numerical functions- f(x,y)=x^y
recognize data - rearrange in ascending order
optimization- find shortest route
solve sudoku, play chess, correct spelling etc.
in this course the first program is finding greatest common divisor 
to find the gcd we need to specify two elements (m,n)
largest K such that K divides both m and n
eg: gcd(8,12)=4
1 divides every number
